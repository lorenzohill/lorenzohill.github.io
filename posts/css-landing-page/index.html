One of the problems that I had with formatting was somewhere I missed the closing tag for a div. When I was working on my CSS after I finished the first it was a nightmare. I made a debug selector so I could see the borders of all the divs. I started at the top and I made my way down the template site. The template site was to build a landing page. The layout had 4 main sections, a header and a footer. The heading and footer were straight forward. I encounter the problems starting in the first main section, the hero banner. When I first started the project, I did not understand how flexbox worked. What I struggled with was the parent and child relationships of elements in a flexbox. The first night I worked on this was a struggle because I did not understand it. I got into a very sour mood because I just could not understand why my code was not working. After about 3 hours of working on the design I decided to call it a night because I was not able to learn in the headspace that was created with the roadblock.\nI was beginning to doubt my abilities at that moment. I knew that I could overcome it. This was the first time in the project that I needed to use grit. This roadblock was not going to stop me. The next evening I decided that it was time to do some additional research. I started by looking at different resources that helped me understand the interactions. I learned how flexbox parent and child elements interacted with each other and what was needed to format the things I wanted. When I worked on the project that evening, I was able to format the hero banner the way that I wanted. This was a major success for me. I decided to end the evening after formatting the hero banner because I was getting later in the evening and I wanted to relax. The third day was the most productive of them all, I formatted the remaining sections of the landing page. One thing that I am going to look more into is sizing and the proper way of sizing elements. I successfully coded the landing page and properly formatted it to look like the example.
