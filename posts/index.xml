      <description>Picking up the CSS flexbox properties was something else. When I started the lessons, I thought it was going to be fine. It was just just laying out the boxes that would lay out how the website looks on a page. I was wrong in that thought.
One of my first shortcomings was that my HTML was not formatted correctly and was not readable. One of the problems that I had with formatting was somewhere I missed the closing tag for a div.</description>

      <description>I started The Odin Project (TOP) in June of 2022. I have had some experience in HTML. When I was about 12, I would play around with the basic of HTML making basic websites that were just really comprised of heading Elements and they basically looked like this.
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;This is a heading&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello World&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt; It was nothing too flashy, Just some HTML code to show up in a browser.</description>
